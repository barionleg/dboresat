title: About OreSat 
---

OreSat is ramping up to be Oregon's first educational nanosatellite! It's a [CubeSat](http://www.cubesat.org/), which is a standard form factor for nanosatellites. OreSat is being designed and built by a loose consortium of Oregon higher education institutions called the Oregon Small Satellite Project. 

The project is being managed by the [Portland State Aerospace Society](http://psas.pdx.edu/) at [Portland State University](http://pdx.edu/). We're the "PIs", if you will. You can contact us at <info@psas.pdx.edu> if you have any comments, concerns or questions.

Other universities involved include Oregon Sate University, University of Oregon, OregonTech, Lane Benton Community College, Portland Community College. Other educational institution should let us know if they want to help out!
