# Oregon's First Satellite


Small educational satellites called [cubesats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat) have been launched by dozens of universities and countries around the world. But so far Oregon has yet to join the elite club of states that have flown a home-grown cubesat in space.

We would like to change that!

[Here's our proposed mission](http://oresat.org/mission/). And [Here's how to get involved](https://github.com/oresat/getting-started/blob/master/README.md). You can also follow our progress on [github](http://github.com/oresat); OreSat is a completely [open source project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware).

Please also consider [donating](https://cconn.foundation.pdx.edu/ccon/new_gift.do?action=newGift&giving_page_id=7&site=giving) to help out Oregon's first nanosat!
