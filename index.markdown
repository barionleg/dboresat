# Oregon's First Satellite

Small educational satellites called [cubesats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat) have been launched by dozens of universities and countries around the world. But so far Oregon has yet to join the elite club of states that have flown a home-grown cubesat in space.

We would like to change that.
