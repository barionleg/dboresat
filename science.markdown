### SCIENCE!

OreSat's [primary mission][mission] is a state-wide educational outreach to bring live video from space to Oregon High Schools. That said, we're looking for opportunities to fly a true Oregon-based science mission. 

Here's our [science mission request for proposals](oresat.org/science/OreSat-Science-RFP.pdf) - feel free to spread it around! But hurry, we only have until October to decide on our mission!
